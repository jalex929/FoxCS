# Example output

`demo-output/` is the unedited output of:

```bash
python grader/auto_grade.py grader/sample-submissions --out-dir examples/demo-output
```

run against the two synthetic submissions in `grader/sample-submissions/`. CI re-runs the same command on every push.

- `auto_grade_report.csv`: one row per submission. STUDENT-0001 earns 36 XP with one naming note (untouched flashcards). STUDENT-0002 earns 3 XP: the misnamed vocab quiz is found and penalized 2 XP, and the empty practice attempt earns nothing.
- `needs_review_manifest.csv`: the six files that go to the AI-assisted review tier, each with its reason.
